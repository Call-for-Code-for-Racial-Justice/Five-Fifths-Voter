# Introduction

## Why Vote

![](WhyVote.png)

**Why Your Vote Matters**

If you think just one vote in a sea of millions won&#39;t make much of a difference, then consider changing that thinking. Your single vote does matter!

Your commitment to having YOUR voice heard matters, especially if you are part of a community of voters who have historically had their voting rights challenged and marginalized.

It is because of these challenges that voting is a journey not just a single act on a single day.

So WELCOME to &quot; **Five Fifths Voter**&quot; where you can easily, safely and securely Get Connected and Get Support to succeed at making your voice and your vote matter.
