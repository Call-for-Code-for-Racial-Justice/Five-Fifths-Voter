**Five-Fifths-Voter Fortification Planning**

# Technology Recommendations

## Platform

- Infrastructure

  - IBM Cloud with OpenShift
  - **Benefits**: OpenShift is based on Kubernetes which is a container orchestration platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

- Web Application Framework

  - VueJS (UI/UX) (In MVP)
  - **Benefits**: Open source JavaScript framework that is small in size; easy to understand and develop applications; known for its flexibility; good detailed documentation
  - ExpressJS (API Framework) (In MVP)
  - **Benefits**: Lets you structure a web application to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url. Express is a minimal, open source and flexible Node. js web app framework designed to make developing websites, web apps, & API’s much easier.

- Artificial Intelligence

  - Watson Discovery (Not in MVP)
  - **Benefits**: This capability is available as a service in IBM Cloud. It is AI-powered search technology that uses text analytics and natural language processing to break open data silos and retrieves specific answers to your questions, while also data mining to analyze and relationships buried in enterprise data.
  - **Some Potential Use Cases**
    - Aggregate in-state data sources to create a body of knowledge for each state to determine actionable insights and to improve tailoring of responses to user based on their location
    - Aggregate date sources across states into a United States body of knowledge to determine actionable insights across states.
    - Aggregate data sources regarding candidates to provide the voter with data points as they assess which candidates they will support and vote for
    - Aggregate data for rating of polling locations
    - NOTE: Implementation of these use cases would improve the overall user experience but especially for the “SME” role

- User Experience Expertise
  - Design experience with improving the usability and accessibility, for users with special needs to include Elderly and Disabled
  - Responsive website design
  - If Artificial Intelligence is integrated with this solution, it has the potential to provide this role with actionable insights and trends on both voters and candidates

## User Experience Goals

- Developer

  - Platform tools are easy to learn, update and maintain

- End Users

  - Provides a tool to assist them with all their voting needs based on the pillars of educate, empower, enable

- Subject Matter Experts
  - Their assessment of the tool determines that for the black
    voter/potential voter it: - Educates them on their right to vote and why they should participate - Educates them of the election process - Equips them with the knowledge to participate in elections

## Test Plan Overview

- Critical Functions List

  - Verify voter Registration
  - Provides requirements and instructions for how to register to non-registered voters
  - Provide voter's district
  - Provide voter’s district voting schedule
  - Provide voter’s polling Locations
  - Provide requirements/instructions for what voter needs to take to polling location (e.g. ID, etc)
  - Provide location for early voting (Advance Voting Location) and instructions
  - Provide instructions for absentee voting/voting by mail
  - Provide transportation options for travel to polling locations
  - Provide capability to rate polling locations

- User Roles
  - Elderly
  - Disabled
  - Millennial

* Potential external partners to support testing
  - HBCUs
  - Black people based non-profit organizations

## Data Sources Overview and Needs

The following data sources were used for the MVP of this solution.
However, for fortification of this solution, alternative sources need to
be determined with a goal to identify partners that can assist with
creating new APIs to meet the requirement of the solution.

- Data Sources

  - vote.org

    - **Background**: Currently using this site to check registration status, voter registration, absentee ballot requests
    - **Potential Next Steps**: Partner with voter.org on API sharing or development; work with individual states to identify data sources for each state

  - Google Civic API

    - **Background**: MVP was focused on the state of Georgia and this source was used to provide acceptable forms of ID for voting and polling locations
      - **Potential Next Steps**: Create an API that brings in data for individual states. Work with individual states to identify data sources for each state

  - Georgia Secretary of State
    - **Background**: MVP was focused on the state of Georgia and this source was used to provide acceptable forms of ID for voting and polling locations
    - **Potential Next Steps**: Create an API that brings in data for individual states. Work with individual states to identify data sources for each state
