# Five Fifths Voter Selenium Testing

**Selenium** is to be used for the automated testing of the front end User Interface from the user perspective for web browser interaction.  
Usage of Selenium can favor a Test Driven Development approach when possible: creation the failing test case shows understanding of the issue or missing feature as well as a recreatable nauture, and can be done by anyone separate from the creation of the code change further enabling collaboration and opportunities to contribute.

# Structure
## **tests/selenium/issues**
These are tests for specific issues. 
The changes for the issues will require a resulting change to the Selenium tests so that the tests will validate the change and pass the test that described the problem.
When the issue is complete, these can be then rolled into the manual tests for inclusion into the build or live_site testing.
Existing behavior issues can usually be seen as a test that fails when it should pass.
The issues can be described as a false positive if the tests pass when they should fail.
