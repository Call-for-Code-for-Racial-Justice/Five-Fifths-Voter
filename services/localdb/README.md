# Emulate deployed Mongo db for local development

The deployed version of this app use an ephemeral Mongo db to store cache data but this Docker image does not get deployed. Instead it emulates the deployed version of the db so that you can develop code locally. If you are working on the early voting locations or absentee drop off locations, you will want to follow these instructions.

To do development work locally then you need a Mongo db that is configured similarly to the deployed db. You might be tempted to work directly with the deployed db but that does not seem like a good idea. If you find a use case for that, document it here but for now lets use a docker image for our local Mongo db.

## Dependencies

- docker [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- OPTIONAL: [Mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/#download-the-mongo-shell)

## Build the DB Docker image

This only needs to be done once.

```sh
cd services/localdb
docker build -t five-fifths-voter/db .
```

## Start the DB Docker image

```sh
# assuming that your localhost port 27017 is not taken. If it is then change the first number to something else. Maybe
# -p 3333:27017
docker run --detach --rm -p 27017:27017 --name five-fifths-voter-db five-fifths-voter/db
```

## Test if your database is available

```sh
mongo --username=userXYZ --password=cacheDataIsNotPrivate localhost:27017/webscrapecache services/localdb/testConnection.js
```

```
MongoDB shell version v3.6.20
connecting to: mongodb://localhost:27017/webscrapecache?gssapiServiceName=mongodb
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("63075c78-e608-4a37-86f4-3cafc4da5c51") }
MongoDB server version: 3.6.3
```

If you do not have the mongo shell, you can kinda test with curl like this:

```sh
curl http://localhost:27017
```

This means it connected ok

```
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

BUT this means something is not working right

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 27017: Connection refused
```

## Stop the Mongo db/Docker image

```sh
docker stop five-fifths-voter-db
docker rm five-fifths-voter-db
```
