            It is through blood, sweat and tears that Black people earned the
            right to vote. Many Black people protested, marched, were arrested
            and even died as they fought the battle for voting equality. We
            implore you to not let these sacrifices be in vain but to cease the
            opportunity that your ancestors provided, that your voice can be
            heard in America.

            In 1868, the 14th Amendment gave Black people the rights of
            citizenship but it would be over 97 years before they could
            successfully execute their right to vote. During this time span poll
            taxes, literacy tests, and other tactics were used to undermine
            Black people&#x27;s right to vote.

            It was not until 1965 when Voting Rights Act was executed that
            provided a successful pathway for Black people to vote. Please
            exercise your right to vote. It was hard earned by your ancestors
