                It is through blood, sweat and tears that Black people earned
                the right to vote. Many Black people protested, marched, were
                arrested and even died as they fought the battle for voting
                equality. We implore you to not let these sacrifices be in vain
                but to cease the opportunity that your ancestors provided, that
                your voice can be heard in America.
              </p>

                In 1868, the 14th Amendment gave Black people the rights of
                citizenship but it would be over 97 years before they could
                successfully execute their right to vote. During this time span
                poll taxes, literacy tests, and other tactics were used to
                undermine Black people&#x27;s right to vote.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was not until 1965 when Voting Rights Act was executed that
                provided a successful pathway for Black people to vote. Please
                exercise your right to vote. It was hard earned by your
                ancestors
