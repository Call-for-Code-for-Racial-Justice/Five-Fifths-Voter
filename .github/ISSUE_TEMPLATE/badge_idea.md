**Describe the badge**

What is the badge for

**How is it earned**

How does someone using the site earn the badge?

**How is it granted**

This is a little tricky. If the user interacts with the site to earn the badge, we can probably programatically grant it if we know what the criteria. 
For instance, we have a badge for creating a team and, since the user creats the team with the site, the site can grant the badge. But what about things 
that happen outside the site? Maybe "drove a friend to vote" should be a badge but how should that be granted?

**Picture of the badge**

What should it look like? See [Redefining Women by Iconathon](https://thenounproject.com/browse/collection-icon/redefining-women-95921/?p=1) for inspiration.
